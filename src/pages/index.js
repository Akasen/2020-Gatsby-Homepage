      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>
        I am Joshua Faria, I am a recent graduate from the University of North
        Florida with a Bachelors Degree in Computer and Information Science.
      </p>

      <p>
        If I had to describe myself with some sort of title, it would be an
        amateur developer
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a curious person, always looking into topics and personal research
        to see how things work and why things are done. I'm also the kind of
        person who if he see's a problem, I immediatley look for solutions,
        scoping out all possibilities and becoming fairly acquainted with my
        issue.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm always looking to learn new things, open to new ideas, and
        constantly motivated to understanding new concepts, tools, and improving
        my means of productivity.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my spare time these days, I'm usually gawking at the latest tech. Be
        it the hottest new graphics card, the next step in AMD's ZEN
        architecture, the rise of Linux as a highly viable OS for gaming, or
        just looking for the next big game to sink hours into.
      </p>

      <p>The next game at this moment I'm looking forward to is Doom Eternal</p>
