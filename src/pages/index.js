      <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>
        I am Joshua Faria, I am a graduate from the University of North
        Florida with a Bachelors Degree in Computer and Information Science.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am a curious person, always looking into topics and personal research
        to see how things work and why things are done. Fond of long nights solving
        problems, working on personal projects, and reading about all the current and
        new technologies which power the web.
      </p>

      <p>
        In my spare time these days, I'm usually gawking at the latest tech. Be
        it the hottest new graphics card, the next step in AMD's ZEN
        architecture, the rise of Linux as a highly viable OS for gaming, or
        just looking for the next big game to sink hours into.
